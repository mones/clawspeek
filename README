Minimalistic Claws Mail password recovery utility
-------------------------------------------------

Sometimes you forgot the password of one of your Claws Mail accounts,
but you have it saved on your accountrc. (Un)fortunately passwords in
accountrc are obfuscated to prevent immediate reading. This utility
helps to recover those passwords without resorting to network sniffing
or debugging the binary.

Notice this program uses the default obfuscation key. In the unlikely
case that this default key has been changed by your software distributor
this utility won't work for you.

Requires make, gcc and glib 2.x for building.

Build instructions:

	make

If everything goes well the clawspeek binary will be created.

Installation:

	make install

Default installation prefix is '/usr/local', you may need to gain root
privileges before installing. You can change location using the PREFIX
variable. Also, DESTDIR variable can be used to specify a different
destination directory (this will be prepended to prefix):

	make install PREFIX=/usr DESTDIR=$HOME/build

Would install binary under $HOME/build/usr/bin, instead of /usr/local/bin.

Removal of previous installation:

	make uninstall

With the same PREFIX and DESTDIR used for installation and the same root
privileges (if required).
