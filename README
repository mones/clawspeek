Minimalistic Claws Mail password recovery utility
-------------------------------------------------

Sometimes you forgot the password of one of your Claws Mail accounts,
but you have it saved on your accountrc. (Un)fortunately passwords in
accountrc are obfuscated to prevent immediate reading. This utility
helps to recover those passwords without resorting to network sniffing
or debugging the binary.

Notice this program uses the default obfuscation key. In the unlikely
case that this default key has been changed by your software distributor
this utility won't work for you.

Requires make, gcc and glib 2.x for building.
(On a Debian Squeeze, install libglib2.0-dev instead of glib)

Build instructions:

	make

If everything goes well the clawspeek binary will be created.

Installation:

	make install
	
Open now the accountrc file in your .claws-mail folder

Find the line beginning with "password=". Your password is here, in an encrypted form.

Then launch the following command in a terminal:

/usr/local/bin/clawspeek '!encrypted-password='
(Of course, replace 'encrypted-password' by the one you found above. Copy and paste the whole password, including the signs ! and =, and don't forget the apostrophes around.)

You're done, here is your precious password!



More informations about installation:

Default installation prefix is '/usr/local', you may need to gain root
privileges before installing. You can change location using the PREFIX
variable. Also, DESTDIR variable can be used to specify a different
destination directory (this will be prepended to prefix):

	make install PREFIX=/usr DESTDIR=$HOME/build

Would install binary under $HOME/build/usr/bin, instead of /usr/local/bin.

Removal of previous installation:

	make uninstall

With the same PREFIX and DESTDIR used for installation and the same root
privileges (if required).

Usage:

The build process generages a standard manpage which contains additional
information and other details. After installation, it can be viewed with:

	man clawspeek

Note that you may need to update man database before that (see mandb
manual page).

If you installed the program to a non-standard location and the above
command doesn't work (not even after updating the man database) you can
also view the generated manpage in the source directory:

	man -l clawspeek.1

As a last resource you can read the manpage directly on github, which
will nicely format the pod for you, point your browser to:
